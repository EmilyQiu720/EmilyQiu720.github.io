## Portfolio Projects

### The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
**Code:** [`The Traveling Salesman Problem`](https://github.com/EmilyQiu720/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/The%20Traveling%20Salesman%20Problem)

**Report:** [`TSP_Project_Report.pdf`](https://github.com/EmilyQiu720/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Machine%20learning%20approaches%20for%20super-resolution%20problems/ML_Approaches_for_Super_Resolution_Problems_Report.pdf)

**Goal:** To assess various algorithmic strategies against the TSPLIB dataset to identify the most effective approaches for symmetric TSP instances.

**Description:** The project implemented a branch and bound algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Python 3.10 and IBM's CPLEX version 22.1.1.0. The DOcplex API facilitates communication between our code and CPLEX, leveraging callbacks to interact during the algorithm's execution. 

Cutting plane techniques, including sub-tour elimination constraints (SECs) and 2-matching inequalities, were implemented to handle fractional solutions. Integer Programming (IP) gap monitoring guided termination by tracking the difference between the incumbent solution and the lower bound. 

Heuristic algorithms were implemented in two ways: 
1) Full construction at root node (warm-start) -- construct a feasible solution from scratch when no incumbent solution has yet been identified;
2) Refinement of a current solution: create integer solutions from fractional solutions or refine current integer solutions.

Nearest Neighbour and two-opt algorithms were selected for heuristic application, complemented by optional algorithms: Constuctions (cheapest insertion, farthest insertion, random insertion, greedy algorithm, nearest insertion, nearest neighbor), improvements (2-opt, 3-opt). 

The approach emphasized systematic node exploration and pruning to efficiently converge to optimal TSP solutions, ensuring a robust and efficient solution process integrating advanced branch and cut techniques with heuristic methods.

**Skills:** linear programming, data handling and manipulation, optimization techniques, algorithm development and optimization, statistical analysis, heuristic methods, performance monitoring, computation efficiency, software integration.

**Technology:** Python (Numpy, Matplotlib, cplex, docplex).

**Results:** The implementations led to significant improvements in solve time TSP instances with more than 200 nodes. Smaller TSP instances are fairly well solvable using the core branch and cut algorithm; thus the augmentations slowed these instances down (however with solve times of under 2 seconds the difference is practically insignificant). 

There is an average of 84.58% improvement in solve time of the medium and large TSP instances from adding all of our augmentations simultaneously and 60% improvement in the solution quality for larger TSP instances which did not solve to optimality. This suggests that our augmentations were indeed successful. 

Notable observations from the data:
- Warm-start ineffective when also implementing heuristic callback 
- The pairing of two matching and connected components leads to terrible solution attempts; specifically worse than adding no implementations at all

We ran the full implementation suite with a 1-hour time-limit on a set of 89 problems from the TSPLIB
- This was all problems that our machine had enough memory to load in: 
- The key observation from this data is that all instances on a specific node size are not equal

### Machine learning approaches for super-resolution problems

**Code:** [`Machine learning approaches for super-resolution problems`](https://github.com/EmilyQiu720/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Machine%20learning%20approaches%20for%20super-resolution%20problems)

**Report:** [`ML_Approaches_for_Super_Resolution_Problems_Report.pdf`](https://github.com/EmilyQiu720/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Machine%20learning%20approaches%20for%20super-resolution%20problems/ML_Approaches_for_Super_Resolution_Problems_Report.pdf)

**Goal:** To investigate the feasibility of generating high-resolution satellite images from lower-resolution inputs by integrating machine learning techniques using python.

**Description:** The project centered on analyzing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite imagery data from Sentinel-1 and Capella Space, specifically within the 2023 Turkeyâ€“Syria earthquakes region. 

The metadata from SAR satellite imagery includes information about the imaging parameters (radiometric resolution, corrdinate reference system, radiometric accuracy) and acquisition conditions (orbit information, sensor configuration, swath width). 

The project invoved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it by applying Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools like Quantum GIS. Tasks included refining image quality through noise removal, radiometric calibration, and speckle filtering processes. 

Mathematical concepts such as bilinear interpolation and entropy comparison were employed for proper image resizing and pixel alignment. Alternative approach for bilinear interpolation method was also implemented: the deep learning model - Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution (EDSRx2) model. 

Machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree) were selected to perform image upscaling. Models were further enhanced through multidimensional feature vectors and Principal Component Analysis. Feature vectors includes surrounding pixel values, RGBI band pixel values from Sentinel-2, calculation of GNDVI, NDVI, and Building index, and integration of building layer from OpenStreetMap. 

**Skills:** data preprocessing, machine learning, deep learning.

**Technology:** Python (skimage, matplotlib, rasterio, numpy, scipy, PyTorch).

**Results:** The investigation reveals challenges due to limited high-resolution SAR images like Capella's.Super resolution methods were relied to upscale low-resolution data, which hinges on their effectiveness. Access to more high-resolution SAR images tailored to specific regions could significantly enhance our results. 

Approach pairing Sentinel-1 data with Capella data shows promise with its efficient use and initial positive outcomes, suggesting a need for further exploration and integration of tailored feature layers to improve model performance.

### Machine Learning Explorer Application (MLx.m)

**Code:** The project code is restricted from public access due to its status as an educational application currently in development. It is designated for private use within the university under the oversight of the professor.

**Goal:** To integrate a new data type (poker hands dataset) to the application; to create new App features by enabling accuracy and loss metrics, along with dynamic confusion chart for models training, testing and deploying automatically.

**Description:** The [pokerhand dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/158/poker+hand) comprises thousands of entries, each representing a sequence of five playing cards characterized by their suit and rank values. The dataset includes attributes such as the suit and rank of each card, encoded numerically (1-4 for suits representing Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, and Spades, and 1-13 for ranks representing Ace through King). Each entry ends with a class label ranging from 0 to 9, indicating the type of poker hand formed by the five cards, such as "Royal Flush" or "Two Pairs". 

The tasks include loading the dataset, visualizing its structure, developing feature selection algorithms, implementing normalization/scaling techniques, preprocessing the data for input into machine learning models, conducting model training and evaluation, optimizing parameters, and visualizing data insights.



**Skills:** Machine Learning, data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** MATLAB (object-oriented coding, graphics and GUI toolbox, statistics and machine learning Toolbox)

**Results:** The Poker Hands dataset is successfully integrated, which expands the application's functionality. This enhancement introduced automated computation of accuracy and loss metrics, providing detailed insights into model performance during training, testing, and deployment phases. 

Additionally, the integration facilitated dynamic generation of confusion charts, enabling real-time visualization and analysis of classification results, thereby enhancing the application's capability to evaluate and refine predictive models effectively.
