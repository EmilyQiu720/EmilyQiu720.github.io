## About
Hi, I'm Emily! I hold a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and am currently pursuing my MS in Analytics at UC Berkeley. My academic background has equipped me with a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics, driving my passion for deriving actionable insights from data across diverse industries. I am eager to apply my technical and analytical skills as an entry-level data specialist in data science.

Beyond academics, I actively explore new data analysis tools and methodologies, continuously expanding my knowledge. Whether collaborating in teams or independently, I find satisfaction in uncovering insights and solving complex problems using data.

Outside of academia, I dedicate my free time to exploring new data analysis tools and methodologies, constantly seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge and skill set. Whether collaborating within a team or working independently, I am motivated by the thrill of discovering new insights and the gratification of leveraging data to tackle intricate problems.

This portfolio highlights my proficiency in various data analysis tools and programming skills, demonstrating my growth and commitment to this dynamic field.

## Portfolio Projects

### The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
**Code:** [`Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb`](https://github.com/EmilyQiu720/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/The%20Traveling%20Salesman%20Problem)

**Goal:** To assess various algorithmic strategies against the TSPLIB dataset to identify the most effective approaches for symmetric TSP instances.

**Description:** The project implemented a branch and cut algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Python 3.10 and IBM's CPLEX version 22.1.1.0. The DOcplex API facilitates communication between our code and CPLEX, leveraging callbacks to interact during the algorithm's execution.

Key features include:

Warm-Start Initialization: Utilizing the Nearest Neighbour and two-opt algorithms to provide an initial solution. (Other optional algorithms are implemented as well)
Integer Programming (IP) Gap: Monitoring the difference between the incumbent and lower bound to guide termination.
Heuristic Callbacks: Constructing feasible solutions to improve the incumbent during the branch and cut process.
Cutting Plane Techniques: Implementing sub-tour elimination constraints (SECs) and 2-matching inequalities for fractional solutions.
Systematic Node Exploration and Pruning: Efficiently exploring and pruning nodes to ensure convergence to the optimal solution.

This approach ensures a robust and efficient solution process for the TSP, integrating advanced branch and cut techniques and heuristic methods.

**Skills:** data handling and manipulation, optimization techniques, algorithm development and optimization, statistical analysis, heuristic methods, performance monitoring, computation efficiency, software integration.

**Technology:** Python: Numpy, Matplotlib, cplex, docplex.

**Results:** Explored an exact solution strategy to the TSP with a set of supplementary augmentations to this solution process. Affirmed that this solution strategy constitutes a viable exact strategy for the TSP and that when applied in conjunction, each of our augmentations do indeed aid the solution process - as is expected given the widespread attention these augmentations have received.
